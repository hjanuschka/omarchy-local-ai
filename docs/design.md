# Local AI

A bar widget that runs the one model validated for each GPU in the machine and opens a coding agent on it. The plugin has five main parts:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `bin/omarchy-local-ai` | The backend: detect GPUs, download and check weights, start and stop containers, open agents, print a snapshot |
| `lib/access.sh` | Whether a model can start (`readiness`), and the re-run under the docker group for a login older than setup; sourced by the backend and the installer |
| `Model.js` | Pure functions: snapshot and ui state in, a view (rows and actions) out |
| `Panel.qml` | Draws the view; turns an action (`verb\|arg\|arg`) into a backend verb |
| `recipes.json` | The vendored recipes, one card kind per line: from [local-ai-registry](https://github.com/0xSero/local-ai-registry)'s `plugin/v2/recipes.json`, plus the explicitly experimental Strix Halo entries from `halogen-recipes.json` until they are validated and moved to the registry. The first recipe on one card is recommended; the rest appear in Config. |

## Flow

The widget polls `bin/omarchy-local-ai snapshot` (every 1.5 s while something starts, 5 s while open, 30 s closed). The snapshot joins the GPUs (`nvidia-smi`, the Arc Pro B70's PCI id and hwmon, `amd-smi`), the recipes and one folder per running model, `~/.local/state/omarchy/local-ai/deploy/<recipe>/` with `config.json` (cards, port, agent, folder) and `status.json` (step, detail, percent, error). While a model loads, detail and percent come from the engine's own log lines (`loadstep`), never from a clock, and the worker ends a start whose card the driver resets (a new devcoredump) or whose engine prints nothing for 15 minutes. `Model.build()` turns that into the page; nothing in the view model has side effects.

A recipe may carry `needs` (`host_ram_gb`, `disk_gb`, `fast_storage: "nvme"`) when it offloads to the host. The snapshot measures the host once (MemAvailable, free space under the models folder, and `lsblk -s` from that folder's filesystem down through dm-crypt or LVM to its drives) and gives each recipe an `unfit` reason, empty when it fits; `Model.js` picks the first recipe that fits and shows the others disabled with the reason, and `run` refuses an unfit one.

`run <recipe> <gpu>[,<gpu>...]` claims the cards and a port under a lock, writes `config.json`, and starts a detached worker. The worker downloads the weights as the user and checks every file's size and sha256 against the Hub listing at the pinned revision, starts the engine and a keyed gateway, waits for the model, and sends one request to check it returns an answer. Each step writes `status.json` and a desktop notification says when it starts, is ready, or failed and why.

The gateway (`ghcr.io/0xsero/gateway`, pinned by digest) listens on `127.0.0.1` only, requires a per-install bearer key, translates the Anthropic and Responses APIs to chat completions for Claude Code and Codex, and writes one usage line per answer. The widget's tokens, speeds, charts and activity grid come from those lines: each model keeps `summary.json` beside its log (tokens per hour, and the counts and sums the averages need), brought up to date from only the lines added since, so once built it costs a snapshot about the same with a million answers as with ten (building it from a large existing log takes a few seconds per 100,000 lines, once).

`open <recipe>` starts the chosen agent in a terminal, in the chosen folder, pointed at the gateway. The key is passed in the agent's environment or in a config file under the state folder that only the user can read; nothing in the agent's own config is changed.

## Privilege

Setup opens one terminal and runs nothing as root itself: Omarchy's Sudoless Docker, then on NVIDIA `omarchy-pkg-add nvidia-container-toolkit`, each with a password prompt that names it (`SUDO_PROMPT`). The toolkit's package hook writes `/etc/cdi/nvidia.yaml`; Docker reads CDI specs on every start, so it needs no configuration change or restart, and an engine gets its cards as `--device nvidia.com/gpu=<uuid>` (an older install with the `nvidia` runtime and no CDI list keeps `--gpus`). Setup ends with the readiness verdict and names, without changing, a Tailscale operator that is not this user and polkit files left by 6.0-6.4. Every later backend operation runs as the user.

A session carries the groups it logged in with, so a login older than setup has the docker group only in `/etc/group`. The backend then runs the verbs that use Docker (`snapshot`, `run`, `stop`, `remove`, `readiness`) again under `newgrp docker`, once (`LOCAL_AI_REEXEC` stops a second try): no root, no password, no logout, and the Docker socket keeps its own permissions.

Whether a model can start is decided in one place, `lib/access.sh`, from machine state and never a plugin version marker. `readiness` prints one of `ready`, `needs-setup` (Sudoless Docker off, the account outside the docker group, no NVIDIA runtime in `docker info`, or a setup that did not finish), `docker-down` (Docker is not running or not answering) or `unsupported` (no Sudoless Docker helper). The snapshot carries it as `readiness: {state, message}`; the panel, a start and setup all read the same answer, and `Model.js` has a page for every state: a Set up Local AI button, or a note that it clears by itself.

The backend validates recipe arguments before starting, mounts paths owned by the user without symbolic links, and labels containers with the user's uid. Stop and remove retain deployment state if Docker cannot remove a container. Legacy 5.x containers without a uid are still adopted. Docker operations and panel polls have time limits; downloads fail on stalled transfers and keep partial files for resumption. Action and poll failures appear on the current page, including Config and unsupported-GPU pages.


## Why it is shaped this way

- **Validated models, vendored.** Every recipe was accepted on its exact card, or cards: download, load, a correctness check, speed at several context lengths. Recipes arrive through plugin updates or an explicit **Refresh models**. Refresh resolves a registry commit, validates its catalog and replaces the cache atomically; failures retain the previous catalog. The backend checks recipe arguments again before a start. A card without an accepted recipe shows Coming soon and links the [supported list](https://github.com/0xSero/local-ai-registry/blob/main/supported/README.md).
- **EXL3 first, engines that serve it in-process.** The registry recommends, per card, EXL3 weights on SGLang or vLLM ahead of TabbyAPI and llama.cpp, then vision, context and measured decode. On a 3090 that is Qwen3.8-27B on SGLang at 200K context and about 90 tok/s.
- **Containers, not packages.** Engines need exact CUDA, ROCm or oneAPI stacks; an image pinned by digest is the smallest thing that reproduces the accepted run.
- **A gateway in front.** Engines differ in API and none checks a key; the gateway gives every engine the same keyed endpoint and the same usage accounting.
- **The view is data.** `Model.js` is plain functions over the snapshot, so every page (home, a running model, a free card, Coming soon) is a function of state and can be rendered without the backend.

## Limits

- AMD cards are found through `amd-smi`, which comes with ROCm; without it they show Coming soon.
- A model has up to 30 minutes to become ready; repeated engine restarts fail sooner. Stop cancels the download or startup worker.
- `newgrp` is how an old login gets the docker group; if it grants nothing (the socket is unreachable for another reason), the state is `docker-down` with the reason, not a request to log in again.
- Tailscale must be running and logged in for sharing; setup preserves another account’s operator. Failed unsharing is logged but never prevents stopping a model.
- `bin/omarchy-remove-ai-local` deletes models, containers, engine images, weights and settings; `omarchy plugin remove sero.local-ai` removes the plugin.
